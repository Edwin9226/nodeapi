node api

** separate routes

** middleware
* middleware stuff but fundamentally just understand that middleware executes in the middle something is happenning something is started and something will end but in  between you want to do something again you want to apply authentication, you want to provide some validation or something like that something you want to push yourself into.

middleware is something you can even write on your own.
